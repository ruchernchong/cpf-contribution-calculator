    "answer": "Following the announcement from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) during the Budget 2023 on 14 February 2023, the CPF income ceiling will be raised gradually from $6000 to $8000 by September 2026. This service has no affiliation with neither the MOF nor the CPF Board."

    "question": "Why are you doing this?",
    "answer": "As a developer, I just love to build things. I created this immediately after the announcement of the CPF income ceiling changes in Budget 2023 (14 February). I wanted to challenge myself and see how quickly could I react to design and deploy to production a particular microservice/product."

  {
    "question": "How are CPF interest rates determined?",
    "answer": "CPF interest rates vary by account type. The Ordinary Account (OA) has a fixed floor rate of 2.5% per annum. The Special, MediSave, and Retirement Accounts (SMRA) have their rates pegged to the 12-month average yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities (SGS) plus 1%, with a minimum floor rate of 4% per annum. You always receive the higher of the pegged rate or the floor rate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between floor rate and pegged rate?",
    "answer": "The floor rate is the minimum guaranteed interest rate your CPF accounts will earn regardless of market conditions. For SMRA accounts, the pegged rate is calculated as the 12-month average of 10-year SGS yield plus 1%. When the pegged rate falls below the floor rate (4%), you receive the floor rate instead. This ensures your CPF savings continue to grow even during periods of low interest rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does my SMRA earn more than 4% sometimes?",
    "answer": "Your SMRA (Special, MediSave & Retirement Accounts) earns more than 4% when the pegged rate exceeds the floor rate. The pegged rate is calculated as the 12-month average of 10-year Singapore Government Securities (SGS) yield plus 1%. When this calculated rate is higher than the 4% floor, you receive the higher pegged rate. This allows your CPF savings to benefit from higher market interest rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the 10-year Singapore Government Securities (SGS) yield affect my CPF?",
    "answer": "The 10-year SGS yield directly affects the interest rate for your Special, MediSave, and Retirement Accounts (SMRA). The SMRA interest rate is pegged to the 12-month average of the 10-year SGS yield plus 1%. When SGS yields are high, your SMRA earns more. When SGS yields are low and the calculated rate falls below 4%, the floor rate of 4% applies to protect your savings. This pegging mechanism ensures your CPF interest rates reflect market conditions while maintaining a safety net."
