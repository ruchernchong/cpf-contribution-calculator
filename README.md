## About

Following the Ministry of Finance announcement at Singapore Budget 2023 (13 February 2023), the CPF income ceiling is being progressively raised:
- **Previous ceiling**: $6,000 (before September 2023)

This calculator helps Singaporeans estimate their take-home income after CPF contributions under the new ceiling structure while accounting for age-specific contribution and distribution rates.
